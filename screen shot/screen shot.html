    <h2>Screen Shot content</h2>
    <p>A screenshot, sometimes referred to as a screencap or screengrab, is an image that shows the contents of a computer display.</p>
    <p> Screenshots let you capture exactly what you’re seeing on your screen and are often shared with others or used as a reference point later on.</p>
    <p> Taking, saving, and sharing screenshots can be extremely helpful.</p>

    <h2>Taking, saving, and sharing screenshots </h2>
    <p> can be extremely helpful. In fact, some insist that the screenshot is the most important thing on the internet. But how can a simple picture of your screen be so vital? Well, screenshots often act as an artifact. They serve as a way to prove to others that you really are seeing the crazy stuff you’re seeing.
        Not only do they help you prove your case, but they also help you archive the past. For example, they can help you capture what a website looked like before the latest brand refresh, that weird error message you got a couple of months ago, or even a juicy gossip article you don’t want to forget.</p>
